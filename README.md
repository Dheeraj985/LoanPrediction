## Loan Approval Prediction

### Problem Statement
Predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant information using various classification models.

### Data Source
The dataset was collected from Kaggle: [Loan Prediction Problem Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset?select=train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv)

### Introduction and Motivation
Many individuals apply for loans with varying incomes, often leading to denials due to insufficient credit history or mismatched loan amounts. Our model aims to predict loan approval status to guide applicants on appropriate loan amounts and the importance of maintaining good credit history.

### Approach

1. **Research Questions**
   - Why is credit history important for loan approval?
   - How does loan amount vary with applicant and co-applicant income?
   - Does having dependents affect loan approval status?
   - What is the average loan amount requested by applicants with dependents?
   - What loan term is typical for approved loans?
   - Which models best predict loan approval?
   - Can loan amounts be predicted apart from loan status?

2. **Goal**
   Identify the best model for predicting loan approval status.

3. **Data Pre-processing**
   - Import data and inspect initial records.
   - Identify numerical and categorical variables.
   - Handle missing values appropriately.
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical.
   - Visualize data to understand variable relationships and select predictors.

4. **Model Building**
   - Split data into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.
   - Apply and evaluate four classification models:
     - KNN Classification
     - Decision Tree Classification
     - Random Forest Classification
     - Logistic Regression
   - Compare models based on validation accuracy.

### Data Pre-processing Steps
- Filled missing values with mean/median as appropriate.
- Converted categorical variables to numerical.
- Visualized data to identify key predictors.

### Data Visualization Insights
- Good credit history significantly increases loan approval chances.
- Applicants with higher incomes generally apply for larger loan amounts.
- Loan amounts applied by those with dependents are often higher, but approval rates are lower.

### Model Comparison
| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| KNN   | 0.8048   |
| Decision Tree | 0.8618 |
| Random Forest | 0.8455 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.8618 |

### Conclusion
Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classification showed the highest accuracy (0.8618). Logistic Regression was selected as the best model.

### Recommendations
- Educate customers on maintaining good credit history.
- Advise applicants to apply for loans within an optimal range of their income.
- Consider dependents and income when applying for a loan.
- Lower interest rates could attract more customers.

### Limitations
- Presence of outliers in numerical data.
- Imbalanced dataset, potentially affecting model accuracy.
